# Iterators in Python

## Introduction
An iterator is an object in Python that allows traversal through all the elements of a collection, one element at a time. Iterators implement the iterator protocol with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

## Key Concepts
- Used to loop through elements one by one  
- Implements `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods  
- Raises `StopIteration` to signal end of iteration  
- Works with loops and generators  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating custom iterator classes  
- Using built-in iterators (e.g., lists, tuples)  
- Understanding the iterator protocol  
- Difference between iterable and iterator
